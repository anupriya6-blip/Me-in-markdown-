hello, my name is Anupriya and i'm a senior at chatsworth. A little bit about myself is that i love playing tennis, I am the part of the girls tennis team here at our school and will be one of the captains this year.(which i am very excited about)!!!. I love coffee a lot to a point where my parents are behind my back to quit it or reduce the amount of coffee which i have, which is is not even that much i would say i have coffee like once in 5 days so probably about once or twice a week. I love to bake which is what i do when i am stressed a lot but i genuinely love to bake for friends family and my teachers. A little bit about my summer is that i wnt to India which i go every year to meet my parents but this year it wasnt planned because my parents came to visit me but due to some emergency i went to India met them, Got an excuse to meet my frinds have a great time with them. So in india i live at a place where it is on the mountains and is not hot i would not say not hot at all but it is okay , when i went this year it was raining which left a really nice weather for going for drives and another hobby of mine is to explore new cafes. Even though i grew up there every year it looks different it has new places to go eat which are amazing , they are all nice,cute, cozy and especially i was with my friends which made this experience of mine more wholesome. I like to walk to places and the weather was so great that my dad and i went to a lot of new place on foot which he did not like at all but did not say anything because he listens to everything i say. So i can say that when i am with my parents they spoil to another level. 
As i mentioned earlier that i was the part of the girls tennis team, I will be having games which will keep me not allow me to attend 5th period incase of away games and when we have home games we would have to leaves 15 minutes to 5th period. I will try my level best to keep up in class and ask other students of what i have missed and email you if i hae doubts or anythng of that sort. 
Due to my skin condition im not allowed to eat any gluten and dairy which had just been told me by my doctor but i loveeeeeee RE coffee and i recommend for you to try it. I also like DAN's CHINESE and Din tae fung!! though im not a sushi fan i like to eat katsu rolls which are one of my favorite.
